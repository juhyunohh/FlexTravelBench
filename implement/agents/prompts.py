PLAN_PARSING = """Please assist me in extracting valid information from a given natural language text and reconstructing it in JSON format, as demonstrated in the following example. If transportation details indicate a journey from one city to another (e.g., from A to B), the 'current_city' should be updated to the destination city (in this case, B). Use a ';' to separate different attractions, with each attraction formatted as 'Name, City'. If there's information about transportation, ensure that the 'current_city' aligns with the destination mentioned in the transportation details (i.e., the current city should follow the format 'from A to B'). Also, ensure that all flight numbers and costs are followed by a colon (i.e., 'Flight Number:' and 'Cost:'), consistent with the provided example. Each item should include ['day', 'current_city', 'transportation', 'breakfast', 'attraction', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'accommodation']. Replace non-specific information like 'eat at home/on the road' with '-'. Additionally, delete any '$' symbols and Cost information (e.g., Cost: 46). Just parse the Plan section of the text.
